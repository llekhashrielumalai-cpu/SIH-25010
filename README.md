## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development

## Proposed Solution
 The solution provides personalized, scientific, and easy-to-access crop advisory services tailored to small farmers’ local conditions and constraints. It bridges the gap between scientific knowledge and grassroots farming practices using technology that is multilingual, voice-enabled, and user-friendly.

Innovation and Uniqueness
	 •	Combines AI + IoT + ML + NLP for integrated decision support.
	•	Image-based pest/disease detection with instant recommendations.
	•	Voice-first approach for semi-literate users.
	•	Hyper-local insights based on soil, crop history, and weather APIs.
	•	Continuous learning through feedback loops from farmers’ inputs.



## Technical Approach
•	Frontend: Android app + WhatsApp/IVR chatbot (React Native / Flutter).
	•	Backend: Python / Node.js microservices with AI/ML models.
	•	AI/ML: Computer vision (TensorFlow/PyTorch) for pest detection, NLP for multilingual support, predictive models for weather & yield.
	•	APIs/Integrations:
	•	Weather API (IMD, OpenWeatherMap)
	•	Soil data (government DB / IoT soil sensors)
	•	Market price API (Agmarknet)
	•	Database: PostgreSQL / Firebase for farmer data & crop history.
	•	Architecture: Cloud-based, scalable (AWS/Azure/GCP).


 
## Feasibility and Viability
•	Technical Feasibility: Uses proven technologies (mobile apps, AI/ML, cloud).
	•	Economic Feasibility: Scalable solution with potential funding from government schemes and agri-tech programs.
	•	Operational Feasibility: Can be rolled out in phases (pilot in select districts → statewide → national).

Potential Challenges & Mitigation
	•	Low digital literacy → Voice-based advisory, pictorial UI.
	•	Connectivity issues → Offline functionality with periodic sync.
	•	Data accuracy → Regular updates from govt. APIs + farmer input validation.


 
## Impact and Benefits
•	Social: Farmers gain confidence and independence in decision-making.
	•	Economic: Increased yield, reduced costs, better market access.
	•	Environmental: Sustainable farming, reduced chemical overuse.
	•	Policy-level: Aligns with Digital India, Doubling Farmers’ Income, and Smart Village initiatives.
 

## Research and References
•	NABARD Report (2022) on farmer classification.
	•	FAO studies on ICT in agriculture (yield improvements).
	•	Agmarknet portal for market price data.
	•	IMD for weather integration.
	•	Case studies of e-Choupal, Kisan Call Centers, and mKisan.
